# Bootcamp Lecture Materials

This repository contains all lecture materials used throughout the bootcamp. The files are organized to directly support following along during live lectures and reviewing content afterward.

The repo is intentionally simple and consists of **two folders only**: one for starter materials and one for completed examples.

## How to Use This Repository

* During lecture, you will primarily work from the **templates** folder.
* After lecture (or if you get stuck), you can reference the **solutions** folder to see a completed version.
* The folder structure and file names in both folders mirror each other to make comparison easy.

## Repository Structure

### `templates/`

Contains **unfilled or partially completed** lecture materials.

* These files are the starting point for each lecture.
* Code may include TODOs, placeholders, or incomplete implementations.
* Students are expected to write code here while following along with the instructor.

This is the folder you should have open during live lectures.

### `solutions/`

Contains the **completed versions** of the lecture materials.

* Each file corresponds directly to a file in the `templates` folder.
* These represent the final state of the code after the lecture is complete.
* Use this folder to:

  * Check your work
  * Catch up if you fall behind
  * Review concepts after class

## Following Along During Lecture

1. Open the relevant file or project from the `templates` folder.
2. Write code alongside the instructor as concepts are introduced.
3. Do not start from the `solutions` folder during lecture.
4. If you fall behind, continue working in `templates` and reference `solutions` only as needed.
